# Machine Learning and AI applications
This repository is a compilation of different applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. Due to my bachelor's degree was in Engineering. I studied several numeric related courses such as linear algebra, statistics, calculus, and data mining. However, I did not have enough experience using Pandas libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Mlxtend, Keras, OpenCV, and NLTK. I decided to take an online course (Lets Upgrade) and work on some projects using their datasets. The following algorithms are used in this repository: 


+ Supervised Learning Algorithms
  +   Support-vector machines (SVM)
  +   Linear regression
  +   Logistic regression
  +   Naive Bayes
  +   Decision trees
  +   K-nearest neighbour 

+ Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
  +   Hierarchical clustering
  +   k-Means
  +   Principal component analysis (PCA)

+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
+ Ensemble Techniques
  +   Bayes optimal classifier
  +   Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) -> Random Forest
  +   Boosting
+ Deep Learning Algorithm
  +   Artificial Neural Network 
  +   Convolution Neural Networks
  +   Recurrent Neural Networks
+ Image preprocessing
  +   OpenCV-image handling

Working on these projects was a successful self-learning experience. I feel proficient at making deep analysis using these libraries and algorithms. There is a lot of content online, so I had alternatives to look for answers when I was stuck.
