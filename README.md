# Machine Learning and AI applications
This repository is a compilation of different applications of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. Due to my bachelor's degree was on Engineering, I studied advanced  courses such as with linear algebra, statistics, calculus, and data mining. However, I did not have enough experience using Pandas libraries as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Mlxtend , Keras, OpenCV, and NLTK. I decided to take an online course (Lets Upgrade) and make some projects using their datasets.
